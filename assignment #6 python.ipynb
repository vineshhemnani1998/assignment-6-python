    "#### Question 1: \n",
    "Define Object Oriented Programming Language?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### introduction:\n",
    "   object oriented programmin(oop)is a paradigum in which real-world objects are each viewed as separate entities having their own state which is modified only by built in procedures, called methods.\n",
    "   ### introduction to OOPs in python\n",
    "   .python is a multi-pradigm programing language. meaning, it supports different programming approch.\n",
    "   .One of the popular approach to solve a programming problem is by creating objects.this is known as object-oriented programming(OOP).\n",
    "   .an object has two characteristics:\n",
    "   .attributes\n",
    "   .behavior\n",
    "   .let's take an example:\n",
    "   .parrote is an object,\n",
    "   .name,age,color are attributes\n",
    "   .singing, dancing are behavior \n",
    "   .the concept of OOP in python focuses on creating reusable code. this concept is also known as DRY(Don't Repeat Yourself).\n",
    "   ##### concepts and pillars of object oriented programming language:\n",
    "   There are four major concepts and pillars of OOP. Namely are:\n",
    "   .inheritance\n",
    "   .Encapsulation\n",
    "   .polymorphism\n",
    "   .Abstraction\n",
    "   ### Inheritance:\n",
    "   inheritance is a way of creating new class for using details of existing class without modifying it. The new class is a derived class (or child class). similarly, the existing class is base class(or parent class).\n",
    "   ### Encapsulation:\n",
    "   Encapsulation is a mechanism where you bind your data and code together as a single unit. It also means to hide your data in order to make it safe from any modification. What does this mean? The best way to understand encapsulation is to look at the example of a medical capsule, where the drug is always safe inside the capsule. Similarly, through encapsulation the methods and variables of a class are well hidden and safe.\n",
    "   ### Abstraction:\n",
    "   Abstraction refers to the quality of dealing with ideas rather than events. It basically deals with hiding the details and showing the essential things to the user. If you look at the image here, whenever we get a call, we get an option to either pick it up or just reject it. But in reality, there is a lot of code that runs in the background. So you don’t know the internal processing of how a call is generated, that’s the beauty of abstraction. Therefore, abstraction helps to reduce complexity. You can achieve abstraction in two ways\n",
    "   a) Abstract Class\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Interface\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s understand these concepts in more detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstract class: Abstract class in Java contains the ‘abstract’ keyword. Now what does the abstract keyword mean? If a class is declared abstract, it cannot be instantiated, which means you cannot create an object of an abstract class. Also, an abstract class can contain abstract as well as concrete methods.\n",
    "Note: You can achieve 0-100% abstraction using abstract class.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use an abstract class, you have to inherit it from another class where you have to provide implementations for the abstract methods there itself, else it will also become an abstract class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s look at the syntax of an abstract class:\n",
    "\n",
    "1\n",
    "2\n",
    "Abstract class Mobile {   // abstract class mobile\n",
    "Abstract void run();      // abstract method\n",
    "Interface: Interface in Java is a blueprint of a class or you can say it is a collection of abstract methods and static constants. In an interface, each method is public and abstract but it does not contain any constructor. Along with abstraction, interface also helps to achieve multiple inheritance in Java.\n",
    "Note: You can achieve 100% abstraction using interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "So an interface basically is a group of related methods with empty bodies. Let us understand interfaces better by taking an example of a ‘ParentCar’ interface with its related methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "1\n",
    "2\n",
    "3\n",
    "4\n",
    "5\n",
    "public interface ParentCar {\n",
    "public void changeGear( int newValue);\n",
    "public void speedUp(int increment);\n",
    "public void applyBrakes(int decrement);\n",
    "}\n",
    "These methods need be present for every car, right? But their working is going to be different.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s say you are working with manual car, there you have to increment the gear one by one, but if you are working with an automatic car, that time your system decides how to change gear with respect to speed. Therefore, not all my subclasses have the same logic written for change gear. The same case is for speedup, now let’s say when you press an accelerator, it speeds up at the rate of 10kms or 15kms. But suppose, someone else is driving a super car, where it increment by 30kms or 50kms. Again the logic varies. Similarly for applybrakes, where one person may have powerful brakes, other may not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since all the functionalities are common with all my subclasses, I have created an interface ‘ParentCar’ where all the functions are present. After that, I will create a child class which implements this interface, where the definition to all these method varies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, let’s look into the functionality as to how you can implement this interface.\n",
    "So to implement this interface, the name of your class would change to any particular brand  of a Car, let’s say I’ll take an “Audi”. To implement the class interface, I will use the ‘implement’ keyword as seen below:\n",
    "\n",

    "27\n",
    "public class Audi implements ParentCar {\n",
    "int speed=0;\n",
    "int gear=1;\n",
    "public void changeGear( int value){\n",
    "gear=value;\n",
    "}\n",
    "public void speedUp( int increment)\n",
    "{\n",
    "speed=speed+increment;\n",
    "}\n",

    "Audi A6= new Audi();\n",

    "A6.printStates();\n",
    "A6.changeGear(4);\n",
    "A6.SpeedUp(100);\n",
    "A6.printStates();\n",
    "}\n",
    "}\n",
    "Here as you can see, I have provided functionalities to the different methods I have declared in my interface class. Implementing an interface allows a class to become more formal about the behavior it promises to provide. You can create another class as well, say for example BMW class which can inherit the same interface ‘car’ with different functionalities\n",
    "### Polymorphism:\n",
    "Polymorphism means taking many forms, where ‘poly’ means many and ‘morph’ means forms. It is the ability of a variable, function or object to take on multiple forms. In other words, polymorphism allows you define one interface or method and have multiple implementations.\n"

    "## Question 2: \n",
    "List down the Benefits of OOP? \n",
    "### 4 Advantages of Object-Oriented Programming:\n",
    "1. Modularity for easier troubleshooting\n",
    "When working with object-oriented programming languages, you know exactly where to look. “Oh, the car object broke down? The problem must be in the Car class!” You don’t have to muck through anything else.\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s the beauty of encapsulation. Objects are self-contained, and each bit of functionality does its own thing while leaving the other bits alone. Also, this modality allows an IT team to work on multiple objects simultaneously while minimizing the chance that one person might duplicate someone else’s functionality\n",
    "2. Reuse of code through inheritance\n",
    "Suppose that in addition to your Car object, one colleague needs a RaceCar object, and another needs a Limousine object. Everyone builds their objects separately but discover commonalities between them. In fact, each object is really just a different kind of Car. This is where the inheritance technique saves time: Create one generic class (Car), and then define the subclasses (RaceCar and Limousine) that are to inherit the generic class’s traits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, Limousine and RaceCar still have their unique attributes and functions. If the RaceCar object needs a method to “fireAfterBurners” and the Limousine object requires a Chauffeur, each class could implement separate functions just for itself. However, because both classes inherit key aspects from the Car class, for example the “drive” or “fillUpGas” methods, your inheriting classes can simply reuse existing code instead of writing these functions all over again.\n",
    "\n",
    "What if you want to make a change to all Car objects, regardless of type? This is another advantage of the OO approach. Simply make a change to your Car class, and all car objects will simply inherit the new code.\n",
    "3. Flexibility through polymorphism\n",
    "Riffing on this example, you now need just a few drivers, or functions, like “driveCar,” driveRaceCar” and “DriveLimousine.” RaceCarDrivers share some traits with LimousineDrivers, but other things, like RaceHelmets and BeverageSponsorships, are unique.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where object-oriented programming’s sweet polymorphism comes into play. Because a single function can shape-shift to adapt to whichever class it’s in, you could create one function in the parent Car class called “drive” — not “driveCar” or “driveRaceCar,” but just “drive.” This one function would work with the RaceCarDriver, LimousineDriver, etc. In fact, you could even have “raceCar.drive(myRaceCarDriver)” or “limo.drive(myChauffeur).”\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Effective problem solving\n",
    "A language like C has an amazing legacy in programming history, but writing software in a top-down language is like playing Jenga while wearing mittens. The more complex it gets, the greater the chance it will collapse. Meanwhile, writing a functional-style program in a language like Haskell or ML can be a chore.\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming is often the most natural and pragmatic approach, once you get the hang of it. OOP languages allows you to break down your software into bite-sized problems that you then can solve — one object at a time"

    "## Question 3: \n",
    "Differentiate between function and method? \n",
    "\n",
    "Python Method\n",
    "\n",
    "Method is called by its name, but it is associated to an object (dependent).\n",
    "A method is implicitly passed the object on which it is invoked.\n",
    "It may or may not return any data.\n",
    "A method can operate on the data (instance variables) that is contained by the corresponding class\n",

    "    def method_name () : \n",

    "        \n",
    "## Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Function is block of code that is also called by its name. (independent)\n",
    "The function can have different parameters or may not have any at all. If any data (parameters) are passed, they are passed explicitly.\n",
    "It may or may not return any data.\n",
    "Function does not deal with Class and its instance concept.\n",

    "  ## Difference between method and function\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Simply, function and method both look similar as they perform in almost similar way, but the key difference is the concept of ‘Class and its Object‘.\n",
    "2.Functions can be called only by its name, as it is defined independently. But methods can’t be called by its name only, we need to invoke the class by a reference of that class in which it is defined, i.e. method is defined within a class and hence they are dependent on that class.\n"

    "## Question 4: \n",
    "#### Define the following terms: 1. Class 2. Object 3. Attribute 4. Behavior\n",
    "# 1. class:\n",
    "Classes in Python\n",
    "Focusing first on the data, each thing or object is an instance of some class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primitive data structures available in Python, like numbers, strings, and lists are designed to represent simple things like the cost of something, the name of a poem, and your favorite colors, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "What if you wanted to represent something much more complicated?\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let’s say you wanted to track a number of different animals. If you used a list, the first element could be the animal’s name while the second element could represent its age.\n",
    "\n",
    "How would you know which element is supposed to be which? What if you had 100 different animals? Are you certain each animal has both a name and an age, and so forth? What if you wanted to add other properties to these animals? This lacks organization, and it’s the exact need for classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes are used to create new user-defined data structures that contain arbitrary information about something. In the case of an animal, we could create an Animal() class to track properties about the Animal like the name and age.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s important to note that a class just provides structure—it’s a blueprint for how something should be defined, but it doesn’t actually provide any real content itself. The Animal() class may specify that the name and age are necessary for defining an animal, but it will not actually state what a specific animal’s name or age is.\n",
    "How To Define a Class in Python\n",
    "Defining a class is simple in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog:\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "You start with the class keyword to indicate that you are creating a class, then you add the name of the class (using CamelCase notation, starting with a capital letter.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, we used the Python keyword pass here. This is very often used as a place holder where code will eventually go. It allows us to run this code without throwing an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The above code is correct on Python 3. On Python 2.x (“legacy Python”) you’d use a slightly different class definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Python  Class Definition:\n",
    "class Dog(object):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "The (object) part in parentheses specifies the parent class that you are inheriting from (more on this below.) In Python 3 this is no longer necessary because it is the implicit default.\n",
    "## 2.Objects (Instances)\n",
    "While the class is the blueprint, an instance is a copy of the class with actual values, literally an object belonging to a specific class. It’s not an idea anymore; it’s an actual animal, like a dog named Roger who’s eight years old.\n",
    "\n",
    "Put another way, a class is like a form or questionnaire. It defines the needed information. After you fill out the form, your specific copy is an instance of the class; it contains actual information relevant to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can fill out multiple copies to create many different instances, but without the form as a guide, you would be lost, not knowing what information is required. Thus, before you can create individual instances of an object, we must first specify what is needed by defining a class.\n",
    "## 3.Attributes\n",
    "All classes create objects, and all objects contain characteristics called attributes (referred to as properties in the opening paragraph). Use the __init__() method to initialize (e.g., specify) an object’s initial attributes by giving them their default value (or state). This method must have at least one argument as well as the self variable, which refers to the object itself (e.g., Dog).\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog:\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Initializer / Instance Attributes\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.age = a\n",
    "   ## 4. Behavior:\n",
    "   Objects in Python are generally classified according to their behaviors and the features that they implement. For example, all of the sequence types such as strings, lists, and tuples are grouped together merely because they all happen to support a common set of sequence operations such as s[n], len(s), etc. All basic interpreter operations are implemented through special object methods. The names of special methods are always preceded and followed by double underscores (__). These methods are automatically triggered by the interpreter as a program executes. For example, the operation x + y is mapped to an internal method, x.__add__(y), and an indexing operation, x[k], is mapped to x.__getitem__(k). The behavior of each data type depends entirely on the set of special methods that it implements.\n",
    "\n",
    "User-defined classes can define new objects that behave like the built-in types simply by supplying an appropriate subset of the special methods described in this section. In addition, built-in types such as lists and dictionaries can be specialized (via inheritance) by redefining some of the special methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Behaviour allows you to say things like:\n",
    "\n",
    "class verifyUserSpecification( behaviour.Behaviour ):\n",
    "\n",
    "        def setUp( self ):\n",
